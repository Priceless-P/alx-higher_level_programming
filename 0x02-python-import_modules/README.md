# Python - Import & Modules

## Summary
This project, completed between Sep 7, 2023, and Sep 8, 2023, explores the fundamentals of Python programming, with a focus on importing functions from external files and modules, handling command line arguments, and understanding Python's capabilities.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I have gained knowledge in the following areas:

1. **Importing Functions**: I learned how to import functions from another Python file/module, allowing me to reuse code and make my programs more modular.

2. **Modules**: I discovered the concept of Python modules and how to create my own modules to organize and encapsulate code.

3. **Command Line Arguments**: I explored how to work with command line arguments in Python, enabling me to make my scripts more versatile and interactive.

4. **Coding Style**: I followed the Pycodestyle style guide for Python code to write clean and readable code.

5. **Conditional Statements**: I used conditional statements to make decisions in my code, such as checking the number of arguments provided in the command line.

6. **Functions**: I implemented various functions to perform specific tasks, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

7. **String Formatting**: I used string formatting techniques to display results in a clear and informative manner.

8. **Error Handling**: I handled potential errors, such as unknown operators or incorrect command line arguments, to provide user-friendly feedback.

## Requirements
To successfully complete this project, I adhered to the following requirements:

- Used Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Ensured that all Python files ended with a new line.
- Included a `README.md` file at the root of the project directory.
- Followed the Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) coding style.
- Made all Python files executable.
- Ensured that the length of Python files was tested using the `wc` command.

## Project Tasks
Here's a brief overview of the tasks completed in this project, with links to the corresponding files on GitHub:

1. **[Import a Simple Function](0-add.py)**: Imported the `add` function from `add_0.py` and performed an addition operation.

2. **[My First Toolbox!](1-calculation.py)**: Imported functions from `calculator_1.py` and performed various mathematical operations.

3. **[How to Make a Script Dynamic!](2-args.py)**: Created a script that printed the number of arguments and their values.

4. **[Infinite Addition](3-infinite_add.py)**: Wrote a program to add an infinite number of arguments provided in the command line.

5. **[Who Are You?](4-hidden_discovery.py)**: Printed all the names defined in the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.

6. **[Everything Can Be Imported](5-variable_load.py)**: Imported a variable from `variable_load_5.py` and printed its value.

7. **[Build My Own Calculator!](100-my_calculator.py)**: Created a calculator program that handled basic operations based on command line arguments.

8. **[ByteCode -> Python #3](102-magic_calculation.py)**: Implemented a Python function `magic_calculation` that mimicked the behavior of provided Python bytecode.

9. **[Fast Alphabet](103-fast_alphabet.py)**: Printed the alphabet in uppercase without using loops, conditional statements, or system calls.

10. **[Easy Print](101-easy_print.py)**: Printed `#pythoniscool` in the standard output within two lines of code.

These tasks helped me reinforce my understanding of Python's core concepts and programming best practices.
