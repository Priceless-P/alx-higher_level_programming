# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Introduction
This is a Python project focused on data structures, specifically lists and tuples. In this project, I learned about the versatility of these data structures and how to manipulate them efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Understanding Python**: I gained a deeper understanding of Python as a programming language and why it's considered awesome for its simplicity and versatility.

2. **Lists**: I learned about lists in Python, how to create and manipulate them, and their similarities and differences compared to other data structures like strings.

3. **List Methods**: I explored the most common methods used with lists, enabling me to efficiently work with data stored in list format.

4. **List Comprehensions**: I delved into list comprehensions, a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterable data types.

5. **Tuples**: I learned about tuples, how to create and use them, and when to choose tuples over lists in certain situations.

6. **Sequence Operations**: I understood the concept of sequences in Python, which includes both lists and tuples, and how they can be accessed and manipulated.

7. **Function Development**: I honed my skills in writing Python functions, taking into account input parameters, return values, and the principles of clean and readable code.

## Project Structure
Now, let's dive into the tasks I completed as part of this project, with links to each specific task file:

1. [Print a list of integers](0-print_list_integer.py): I wrote a function that prints all the integers in a list.

2. [Secure access to an element in a list](1-element_at.py): I created a function that retrieves an element from a list while handling edge cases.

3. [Replace element](2-replace_in_list.py): I implemented a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position.

4. [Print a list of integers... in reverse!](3-print_reversed_list_integer.py): I wrote a function to print all integers in a list in reverse order.

5. [Replace in a copy](4-new_in_list.py): I developed a function to replace an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

6. [Remove characters](5-no_c.py): I created a function that removes all occurrences of the letter 'c' (both uppercase and lowercase) from a string.

7. [Lists of lists = Matrix](6-print_matrix_integer.py): I implemented a function to print a matrix of integers, which is essentially a list of lists.

8. [Tuples addition](7-add_tuple.py): I wrote a function that adds two tuples and returns the result as a new tuple. The function handles tuples of different lengths and fills missing values with zeros.

9. [More returns!](8-multiple_returns.py): I created a function that returns both the length of a string and its first character. If the string is empty, the first character is set to None.

10. [Find the max](9-max_integer.py): I developed a function that finds the largest integer in a list without using the built-in `max()` function.

11. [Only by 2](10-divisible_by_2.py): I wrote a function that identifies whether each element in a list is divisible by 2 and returns a new list of Boolean values.

12. [Delete at](11-delete_at.py): I implemented a function that deletes an element at a specific position in a list without using the `pop()` method.

13. [Switch](12-switch.py): I created a short Python script that demonstrates how to swap the values of two variables, `a` and `b`.

14. [CPython #0: Python lists](100-print_python_list_info.c): In this advanced task, I dived into the CPython implementation of Python and created a C function that prints information about Python lists, including size and allocated memory.
